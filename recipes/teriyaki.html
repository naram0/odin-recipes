        <h2>description</h2>
            <p>these savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. 
                they are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend dinner parties.</p>
            <p>prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. i prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), 
                however use what you have on hand.</p>
